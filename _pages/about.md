I am a 4th year Ph.D Student in Biostatistics from University of California, San Diego. I am co-advised by [Professor Armin Schwartzman](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/people/armin-schwartzman/) and [Professor Jingjing Zou](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/jingjing.zou) on spatial confidence region on fMRI data, and transformer based autoencoder models in application to wearable device data. My interest lies in statistical frameworks in spatial inference in fMRI brain imaging data, time-series data analysis (in wearable device data) using deep learning methodologies, and various biomedical applications of statistical models.
