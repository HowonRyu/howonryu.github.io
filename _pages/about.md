I am a Ph.D Candidate in Biostatistics from University of California, San Diego. I am co-advised by [Professor Armin Schwartzman](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/people/armin-schwartzman/) and [Professor Jingjing Zou](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/jingjing.zou) on spatial confidence region on fMRI data, and transformer based autoencoder models in application to wearable device data in physical activity.


My interest lies in digital health using deep learning methodologies, statistical frameworks in spatial inference in fMRI brain imaging data, and various biomedical applications of complex statistical models. More details can be found under [research interests.](https://howonryu.github.io/research/)
